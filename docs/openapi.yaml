    # Introduction

    **The Data Exchange (DX) Access Control List (ACL) based Access Policy Domain (APD)** are designed for creating and managing policies for consumers and consumer delegates.
    This allows providers and provider delegates to control access to their resources by consumers and consumer delegates.
    This API specification for ACL APD requires a valid identity token from the **Data Exchange (DX) Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Server** for authentication purposes.

        Get all latest policies associated with a specific user. The response is determined by the user's roles:

        - If the user is a `provider`, the response includes all policies created by the provider or their delegates.
        - If the user is a `delegate`, the response comprises policies set by the delegate or set for the consumer on whose behalf the delegate is acting.
        - If the user is a `consumer`, the response includes policies set for the consumer.

        `Note`: Please note that the response displays the policies for a user concerning a specific server.

      summary: Create Policy
      description: |-

        The `Create Policy` API empowers both `providers` and their `delegates` to establish policies for resources owned by the `provider`. It enables `providers` to define policies for resources they own, and `delegates` can create policies on behalf of `providers` who own the resources.

        ## User Policies

          User policies, which are applicable to the `RESOURCE` and `RESOURCE_GROUP` item types, can be defined by a `provider` or its `delegate`. These policies regulate access to resources owned by the `provider` and apply to `consumers` accessing these resources.

        ## Item Types

        - `RESOURCE`: Policies can be applied to individual resources.
        - `RESOURCE_GROUP`: Policies can be set for resource groups.

        By utilizing the `Create Policy` API, `providers` and their `delegates` can effectively manage access control and resource governance within the system.

        `Note`: Only one policy can be generated per request.

            ### User Policy Request:

            - `userEmail`: The email ID of the user for whom the policy is being defined.
            - `itemId`: The UUID value of the item for which the policy is being established.
            - `itemType`: An enum value representing the type of the item.
            - `expiryTime`: An optional field, representing the policy's expiry time in ISO8601 format compatible with UTC (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss). If not provided, a default expiry time is set for the policy.
            - `constraints`: A JSON object containing constraints that the resource server can interpret.
